    <p>New Chevorlet Corvette C8</p>
    <img src="images/chevy1.jpg" width="500" height="300"  />
    <p>
        Recently Chevorlet announced a new Mid-Engine Chevy Corvette. And the body style is, <i>Different</i>
        to say the least.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chevy finally gave in to making a mid-engine 'vette from the many years of chevy fanboys
        and fangirls asking for a mid-engine 'vette. Some of us are happy, and many are not....
    </p>
    <p>
        Something very intresting is that Chevy decided to stick a trunk in the front and in the back,
        in other words means that Chevy is making a front trunk and a rear trunk even with the engine in the back to have a total amount of 13 cubic feet of space,
        2 less than the previous C7 Corvette
    </p>
    <p>The Chevorlet Corvette C8 is supposed to launch July 18<sup>th</sup> 2019</p>

    <h3>New Tesla Model Y</h3>
    <img src="images/high-body-focus.jpg" width="500" height="300" /> <br />
    <p>Elon Musk announced a new Tesla, named the Tesla Model Y, which completes the "S3XY" Tesla model lineup, the Tesla Model S, Model 3, Model X and newly announced Model Y.</p>
    <p>The only difference between the Model X and the Model Y is the Model Y will have a higher body frame and has a optional third row seating. </p>
    <p>
        Which will increase the seating from five in the Model X to seven with this option. The only downside is that because of the coupe look on the Model Y you would have to be me,
        meaning pretty short to fit in the third row
    </p>
    <p>sadly i could not find a motor trend review on the Tesla Model Y, which sucks.</p>

    <!--hello future rat boy, make a website to display the tesla model lineup names to explain how it be-->

    <h3>Its Truck Month. Time to announce the new Ram 1500 Rebel TRX</h3>
    <img src="https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/digitaltrends/ram-rebel-trx-concept-1500x1000.jpg" width="500" height="300" />

    <p>
        Rumor has it that the new Rebel TRX would have a 707-hp hellcat powered engine inside this already beast of a truck. But Ram wont officially confim it sadly.
        Like who doesn't want 707 horses in your truck
    </p>
    <p>The name TRX sounds a lot like T-Rex. Which is taking a shot at the lesser Ford Raptor for the fact that the TRX will be compete against the Raptor.</p>
    <p>Apparently in the reviews page in motor trends website the TRX doesn't even exist....</p>
